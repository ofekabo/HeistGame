LASER SCRIPT - DESCRIPTION:

'New Max Color' - Maximum color if you want a range of colors.
'New Min Color' - Minimum color useful for when creating a range. Use same color as 'New Max Color' if you don't want any color range.
'Line Renderers' - This is the core of the Lasers. It's a list of Line Renderers.
'Fire Point' - The starting position of the Laser.
'End Point' - The end position of the Laser. If using an input to control the endpoint, like the mouse for example, then assign the camera.
'Bounces' - How many times the Laser bounces when it collides.
'Size' - Multiplies the original size of the Laser (eg: 0.5 - half the size / 2 - double the size).
'Maximum Length' - The maximum length the Laser will have.
'Overgrow' - How much it overgrows when the Laser is fired.
'Grow Speed' - The speed which the overgrow grows.
'Shrink Speed' - How fast it shrinks when we stop shooting.
'Disable Delay' - How many seconds before the Laser is disabled.
'Start VFX' - Parent of all the particles systems at the start of the Laser.
'Use Start' - Enable or Disable the use of the Start effects.
'Reflect Start' - When using bounces, you can choose if you want to duplicate the Start VFX.
'Middle VFX' - Parent of all the particles systems at the middle of the Laser.
'Use Middle' - Enable or Disable the use of the Middle effects.
'Reflect Middle' - When using bounces, you can choose if you want to duplicate the Middle VFX.
'End VFX' - Parent of all the particle systems at the end of the Laser.
'Use End' - Enable or Disable the use of the End effects.
'Use End Always' - Enable or Disable the End effects when not colliding.
'Reflect End' - When using bounces, you can choose if you want to duplicate the End VFX.
'Trail VFX' - The particle system that leaves a trail.
'Use Trail' - Enable or disable trail.
'Reflect Trail' - When using bounces, you can choose if you want to duplicate the Trail.
'Trail Interval' - The interval between each trail - 0 means a continuous trail.
'Generate Colliders' - Generates colliders for each collision.
'Is Collider Trigger' - Are the generated colliders in trigger mode?
'Collider Radius' - Box Collider size.
'Layer Name' - Set the name of the Layer where the Laser is going to be.
'Layer Order To' - Moves all the Particle Systems and Trails by the amount entered here.




PARTICLE SYSTEM CONTROLLER SCRIPT - DESCRIPTION:

Options:
'Size' - Multiplies Particle Systems and Trails sizes.
'Speed' - Multiplies Particle Systems and Trails speeds.
'Loop' - Enable/Disable Particle Systems loop.
'Lights' - Enable/Disable Particle Systems lights.
'Trails' - Enable/Disable Particle Systems trails.
'Changes Color' - Enable/Disable changing color of Particle Systems and Trails speeds.
'New Max Color' - New maximum color.
'New Min Color' - New minimum color.
'Particle Systems' - The Particle Systems and Trails the prefab contains. Can be filled automatically with 'Fill Lists' button, or manually.
'Active Particle Systems' - Choose which Particle Systems and Trails are active. Can be filled automatically with 'Fill Lists' button, or manually.
'Fill Lists' - Finds and adds Particle Systems and Trails, of the parent and childs of current gameobject, to 'Particle Systems' and 'Active Particle Systems' lists.
'Empty Lists' - Emptys 'Particle Systems' and 'Active Particle Systems' lists.
'Apply' - It will apply the changes you made (Size, Speed, Loop, Lights Enabled/Disabled, Trails Enabled/Disabled, Change Color) to the particle systems in 'Particle Systems' that ARE active in the 'Active Particle Systems' list. It will also save the original settings in a folder called 'Original Settings' inside the folder of the vfx prefab.
'Reset' - Resets the Particle Systems and Trails to the original settings which are saved in a folder called 'Original Settings' inside the folder of the vfx prefab.

Workflow:
1) Add script to any VFX prefab;
2) Press 'Fill Lists' to automatically find and add Particle Systems and Trails to lists;
3) Make your changes (Size, Speed, Loop Enabled/Disabled, Lights Enabled/Disabled, Trails Enabled/Disabled, Change Color, Enable/Disable Particle Systems with 'Active Particle Systems' lists);
4) Press 'Aplly';
5) Script saves original settings and applies changes;
6) That's it, enjoy. 
PS: You can always press 'Reset' to go back to original settings.

Warnings:
1) Don't change the name of the VFX after you have pressed 'Apply'. Otherwise 'Reset' will not work since it wouldn't be able to find the original settings.
2) You can change the name of the VFX BUT you must go to the respective 'Original Settings' folder and copy paste the exact same name of the VFX. Watch video for a demonstration.
3) 'Fill Lists' won't work if the gameobject contains a Particle System and a Trail (at least for now)
